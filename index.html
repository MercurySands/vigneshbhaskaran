            <p class="paragraph about">I am currently a Research Assistant in the <a href="https://ode.engin.umich.edu/" target="_blank">Optimal Design Laboratory</a> at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, working with Professor Panos Papalambros on exciting ways to learn about and execute the product design process. <br/><br/>I received my M.S.E in Mechanical Engineering from U.Mich in Dec. 2017, specializing in Design. During my masters I worked on the design of a Solar Car, Optimization problems associated with modular UAV systems and on the teaching and learning aspects of product design.<br/><br/>Prior to joining my masters program I worked on concept development and deployment of an Off-Grid Cold-Storage intended for use by marginal farmers in Chennai, India. This was an effort to apply core engineering skills gained in my bachelors degree in mechanical engineering and also engage with farmers in my community with whom I grew up.<br/>‍

        <p class="paragraph about">My favorite thing to do so is to participate in making interesting objects. I am usually always working on team projects I also love to interact with children and conduct/participate in workshops on engineering and product design with children such as <a href="https://campsforkids.engin.umich.edu/xplore/" target="_blank">Michigan Xplore Engineering</a>. My second favorite thing to do is to ask questions. This is a habit carefully formed with help from my physics professor Ravi Shankar who would always lead a co-learning session with the requirement of that the student ask questions before receiving answers. It follows strongly from the way Richard Feynman would approach learning.<br/>‍<br/>My interest in design arises from principles in physics, mathematical optimization, product engineering and learning sciences. Some physical objects I have helped make are detailed below. I also enjoy learning with others and teaching about making products.<br/><br/>For questions and challenges you may have for me please use the following email link:

        <h2 class="heading-2">Aerodynamics</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Around 80% of all power consumption for the Solar car comes from aerodynamic drag losses. While we want the best aerodynamic performance we also want to ensure optimal solar array performance from incident solar radiation, ensure stability of the car in a straight line and also preserve driver safety. We want to build the fastest car possible for the current technology and have scope for incorporating radical new technologies in the future, while remaining true to our goals of building a safe car.<br/><br/>See the video below on a summary of the design process and earlier versions of the car. Video made as a sponsor video by Siemens.<br/>

We are able to run 2-3x higher number of simulations than any previous year. We then use genetic algorithms to determine optimal geometry of the car. This allows for faster exploration and quick iterations with mechanical, composites and the solar array team. <br/>We built the car with no millimeters to spare between the driver and the safety zone in the roll cage. One millimeter has a significant impact on performance! The car is built on a fundamental philosophy: &quot;What would a solar car look like with only the driver and as little car as possible?&quot; <br/><br/>While this design might have placed second at the solar challenge contests, it certainly has the potential to be the fastest solar powered car in the world. In subsequent project cycles we will explore further concepts related to generative designs and associated additive manufacturing techniques. Hush hush!

We use an evolution of this process with aluminium core as stiffening/lightweighting material to make a fully composite body and chassis (including roll cage). We use the CAD models to machine foam plugs which are then polished and waxed to a smooth shine. We then lay carbon weaves and form the moulds in the process shown below. We repeat the above process with moulds instead of plugs to make the final car.

This project involved multiple prototyping stages and usability testing and testing in clinical settings at the University of Michigan and testing in Ghana in collaboration with the University of Ghana. <br/></p><div class="w-row"><div class="w-col w-col-6"><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a63b73ea6d4b0000108caa3/5b98b8c55a55675ade173021_implant%20insertion%20infographics.png" width="291" alt="Cartoon depicting the location of contraceptive implants in the arm" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a63b73ea6d4b0000108caa3/5b98b8c55a55675ade173021_implant%20insertion%20infographics-p-500.png 500w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a63b73ea6d4b0000108caa3/5b98b8c55a55675ade173021_implant%20insertion%20infographics.png 719w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 76vw, 291px" class="image"/><div><em class="caption">Image: Cartoon depicting the location of contraceptive implants in the arm</em></div></div><div class="w-col w-col-6"><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a63b73ea6d4b0000108caa3/5b98b8c8c057680d9a58d5c0_Implant%20removal%20assistant%20prototype.jpg" alt="Prototype of device to stabilize the area surrounding the implant and assist in removal" width="417" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a63b73ea6d4b0000108caa3/5b98b8c8c057680d9a58d5c0_Implant%20removal%20assistant%20prototype-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a63b73ea6d4b0000108caa3/5b98b8c8c057680d9a58d5c0_Implant%20removal%20assistant%20prototype-p-1600.jpeg 1600w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a63b73ea6d4b0000108caa3/5b98b8c8c057680d9a58d5c0_Implant%20removal%20assistant%20prototype-p-2000.jpeg 2000w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a63b73ea6d4b0000108caa3/5b98b8c8c057680d9a58d5c0_Implant%20removal%20assistant%20prototype-p-2600.jpeg 2600w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a63b73ea6d4b0000108caa3/5b98b8c8c057680d9a58d5c0_Implant%20removal%20assistant%20prototype-p-3200.jpeg 3200w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a63b73ea6d4b0000108caa3/5b98b8c8c057680d9a58d5c0_Implant%20removal%20assistant%20prototype.jpg 3559w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 87vw, (max-width: 767px) 417px, (max-width: 991px) 334px, 417px" class="image"/><div><em class="caption">Image: Prototype of device to stabilize the area surrounding the implant and assist in removal</em></div></div></div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a63b73ea6d4b0000108caa3/5b98b8c85a55670795173023_Implant%20insertion%20in%20Ghana.png" width="539" alt="Clinical Testing and Observations conducted in Ghana (Accra &amp; Kumasi)" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a63b73ea6d4b0000108caa3/5b98b8c85a55670795173023_Implant%20insertion%20in%20Ghana-p-500.png 500w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a63b73ea6d4b0000108caa3/5b98b8c85a55670795173023_Implant%20insertion%20in%20Ghana-p-800.png 800w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a63b73ea6d4b0000108caa3/5b98b8c85a55670795173023_Implant%20insertion%20in%20Ghana.png 1062w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 92vw, (max-width: 767px) 93vw, 539px" class="image"/><div><em class="caption">Image: Clinical Testing and Observations conducted in Ghana (Accra &amp; Kumasi)</em></div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a63b73ea6d4b0000108caa3/5b98b8f05a556779bf173038_Usability%20test.png" width="449" alt="Prelimnary Usability testing conducted in Ann arbor" class="image"/><div><em class="caption">Image: Preliminary Usability Testing conducted in Ann Arbor.</em></div><h1 class="heading-3">Design of Jigs and Fixtures for Welding assembly of Railway Coaches</h1><p class="paragraph">Fixture to enable better ergonomics for welders on shop floor and to enable quick adjustment for coaches of varying widths.

I also love to make purchase recommendations for systems with satisfaction guarantees based on individual persons software requirements. So far have purchased around 10-12 laptops for others. I also do have experience building websites, hosting serves, Linux distros. Mostly I enjoy playing low bit browser games and building code in the arduino IDE.

I love to repair lenses in addition to watches which will be added as I learn watchmaking at some point in the future as I acquire tools. I use a Sony camera just because of the lowest Flange distance (Distance between the mounting point of the lens and the sensor inside the camera) of 18mm which is lower than any vintage lens&#x27;s flange distance. This means that any lens made in human history can be adapted to this camera using the appropriate mounting mechanism and adapter height to compensate for the lower flange distance.
